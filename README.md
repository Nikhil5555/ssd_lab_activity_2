1) q1.sh 
First I checked the number of lines are even or odd.
If its even we will don't add one to it and will just divide it by 2.
If its odd we will first divide by 2 and than will add one to it.
Than I used head to get the first half number of lines and used tail to get the last of them.
Use ./q1.sh "<file_path>" to run the script.


2) q2.sh
I used awk command to do this question,than I did spliting using '/'.
Than I checked the second column which is 'usr' and than printed the corresponding last column.
